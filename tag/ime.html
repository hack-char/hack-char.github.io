<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>A few months ago, there was a white paper 'Silent Bob is Silent' describing an Intel ME vulnerability.
There were a whole slew of new vulnerabilities found <a class="reference external" href="https://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00086&amp;languageid=en-fr">Intel ME CVEs</a></p>
<p>The best write up describing these new issues is in this Trend Micro
<a class="reference external" href="http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/mitigating-cve-2017-5689-intel-management-engine-vulnerability/">blog</a></p>

<h3>What's vulnerable?</h3>
<p>Everyone that bought a new computer in the last decade or so.
But might not be as disasterous as some have made it out to be. Assuming you don't have remote managability features enabled...</p>
<p>To get useful information, use this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/zamaudio/intelmetool">IntelMEtool utility</a>
Make sure to follow the instructions and <tt class="docutils literal">rmmod</tt> the me modules as well as issue a <tt class="docutils literal">iomem=relaxed</tt> to your kernel boot args.</p>
<p>The output for this tool on my computer looks like this (without trying to invasively remove the Intel ME):</p>

Bad news, you have a `Sunrise Point-H CSME HECI #1` so you have ME hardware on board and it is very difficult to remove, continuing...

<p>Also you could get the official 'detection' utility from intel:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025619/software.html</a></p>
<p>The output above gives me confidence my laptop is not remotely exploitable as the manageability features are all disabled. The VLAN capability is a little bit
disconcerting, but to help prove to myself its at least not remotely exploitable - scan the ports associated with the AMT features: 16992-16995 and 623 and 664.</p>
<p>That is not to say I am not affected. I am. However, the one remotely exploitable CVE is not likely an issue for my machine.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-can-you-do">
<h3>What can you do?</h3>
<p>Remove Intel ME!
This is a pretty drastic step, and will require you are familiar with hardware.
Specifically, you will need to physically connect to the flash chip on your motherboard that contains the Intel ME firmware code. You then dump the code to a local machine,
use a utility to attempt a patch and then re-program the chip. If it works, you can boot back up and see most functionality was disabled.</p>
<p>Follow this great <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki%27s_EFI_Install_Guide/Disabling_the_Intel_Management_Engine">guide</a> to do everything possible
to remove or disbable as much of the Intel ME as possible. Also refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner">me_cleaner</a> site which is used to make
the actual modifications to your dumped firmware.</p>
